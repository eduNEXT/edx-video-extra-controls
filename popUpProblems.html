<!--
Video-Embedded Problems Controller!
Copy-and-paste all of this into a Raw HTML element under your video.
The table below tells us what time (in seconds) each problem will pop up.
Problems are called by name - make sure the name matches exactly and there are no duplicates.
Note that every row but the last one needs a comma.
-->

<script>
		var popUpProblemTimer = [{
	start : 4,
	end : 5,
